This folder contains interactive HTML-based educational notebooks for ECE350 - Semiconductor Electronic Devices.

## Contents

- **Crystal Structures** - Introduction to crystal structures, lattices, and Miller indices (Lectures 2-3)
- **Energy Bands** - Bloch's theorem, Kronig-Penney model, and E-k diagrams (Lectures 6-7)
- **Crystal Potential Visualizations** - Interactive 2D/3D visualizations of periodic potentials
- **Effective Mass** - Effective mass concept and band diagrams (Lectures 8-9)
- **Carriers at Thermal Equilibrium** - Density of states and Fermi-Dirac distribution (Lectures 9-11)
- **Carrier Drift** - Drift velocity, mobility, and scattering mechanisms (Lecture 12)
- **Band Bending** - Electrostatics and energy diagrams (Lecture 12)
- To be updated as the course progresses

## Viewing the Documentation

Open `index.html` in a web browser to access all notebooks.

## Separate Repository

This docs folder can be maintained as a separate repository to facilitate sharing and collaboration while staying synced with the main ECE350 repository.

### Repository Structure

- **Main Repository**: `joyce-poon/ECE350` - Contains all course materials including docs (Private)
- **Docs Repository**: A separate repository containing only this docs folder (for sharing)

### Syncing Changes

See [DOCS_REPO_SETUP.md](../DOCS_REPO_SETUP.md) in the root of the main repository for detailed instructions on:
- Creating the separate docs repository
- Pushing changes from main repo to docs repo
- Pulling changes from docs repo back to main repo
- Automated syncing with GitHub Actions
